## Project Description
  
This project is part of the Ironhack data analytics bootcamp. The goal of this project was to visualize and analyse a dataset with Tableau. 
  
## Dataset
  
The data visualizations are based on a dataset from this source: https://sit.instructure.com/courses/26331/files/3460457  The data in this csv file was most definetely conducted by the author from sources like these wikipedia pages (see links below) and through webscraping. 
The table originally consists of 26 columns, with data of all James Bond movies until 2012. I manually added information of the last movie from 2015 to have a complete dataset of all 24 movies. 
  
## Workflow
  
- I discovered the dataset via a random google search, after some unseccesful browsing on kaggle.com. There was almost no description over the content of the file, just a preview of the first two rows of the textfile.  
  
- Before importing the table into Tableau, I had to fill one empty cell in column "Years lapse" with a 0 and change all . to , in columns with numeric data.  
  
- Once the file was imported, I created about 14 visualizations, 6 dashboards and compiled them in a story.  
  
- At the end I added notes and descriptions to the story to explain and point out interesting findings.
